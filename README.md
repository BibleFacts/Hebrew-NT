# Hebrew-NT

This repository is for the development of a English version of a Hebrew New Testament based on the Salkinson-Ginsberg Hebrew New Testament (1881).
The plus sign after the name of the book (eg. 3John+) indicates it has the Stong’s dictionary after each relative English word. This is designed to be used with E-sword and MySword Bible software.
A book without the plus sign (eg. 3John) indicates the current polished translation.
